their true spirit. A &ldquo;Signing of the Compact&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Departure from
Delfthaven,&rdquo; for example, that employs the sentimental piety, the eyes and
arms raised to heaven, of Italian Baroque art, (that Jesuitical, most Catholic
art), fails to reflect the real spirit of the Protestant Pilgrims. The use of the
gracefully reclining and swooning figures of Italianate renaissance art is likewise
inappropriate.</p>
<p>Reacting sharply from this, the illustrations in the book portray in the
modern spirit both the activities of the Pilgrims and their settings with strict
realism.</p>
<p>Unsparing effort in consulting authorities, old documents, prints, and actual
scenes was expended to secure convincing authenticity.</p>

<h2><span class="small">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>No phase of early American history presents a finer
example of faith, fortitude and determination of purpose
than the story of that little band of devout souls who
landed at Plymouth in the winter of 1620 and to whom we
refer as the Pilgrims.</p>
<p>In the following limited pages the writer attempts to
present something of the conditions obtaining in England
prior to the Departure, also something of the struggles,
privations, courage and forbearance during the first years
of the settlement at Plymouth.</p>
<p>In so doing dependence is placed particularly upon the
contemporaneous writings of Bradford and Winslow, both
members of the Mayflower party.</p>
<p>With the vast bibliography relating to the Pilgrim history,
together with the requirements of brevity, it is indeed
fortunate that we are able to look to those who played such
an important part in this historic episode and who were
thoughtful enough to leave a record for posterity.</p>
<p>It is difficult to epitomize a story so broad and sweeping
in its ramifications, its religious and material aspects and
its touch of romanticism. Consequently it is intended to
include only such events as may prove of interest and value
to the reader as adduced from the recognized authorities.</p>
<p>These authorities as before indicated are:</p>

<p class="tb">Note:&mdash;With regard to the original manuscript of Bradford&rsquo;s
History of Plymouth Plantation, it may be stated
that it was first obtained by Thomas Prince, the historian,
from Judge Sewall, to whom it was &ldquo;lent but only lent&rdquo;
by Major John Bradford of Kingston, son of Major William
Bradford, formerly Deputy Governor of the Plymouth
Colony, and grandson of Governor William Bradford.</p>
<p>This precious document which seems to have passed
through several hands, finally found refuge, together with
Prince&rsquo;s library, in the tower of the Old South Church in
Boston, whence it later disappeared.</p>
<p>In 1856 it was found in the library of the Lord Bishop
of London, at Fulham Palace. A transcript was made and
it was printed in Boston the same year, under the auspices
of the Massachusetts Historical Society.</p>
<p>In 1897 the original manuscript was brought to this
country by the Hon. Thomas F. Bayard, our Ambassador
to England at the time, to whom it had been delivered
by the Rt. Rev. Mandell Creighton, Lord Bishop of London.
Much credit is due to the late Senator George F. Hoar of
Massachusetts, to the former Bishop of London, Dr.
Temple, who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and the aforementioned Ambassador Bayard, who were
all in accord as to the right and justice of the transfer.</p>
<p>This historic document now reposes in the state library
in the State House in Boston, priceless in both historic and
sentimental value.</p>

<h2><span class="small">FOREWORD</span>
<br />Expansion on Cape Cod</h2>
<p>The early settlements on Cape Cod all came about under
the aegis of the parent colony in Plymouth. Several times
in Pilgrim chronicles we read how Captain Myles Standish
was sent to Sandwich, Barnstable and Yarmouth on tours
of inspection and to supervise the division of lands purchased
for little or nothing by the newcomers from the
remnants of an Indian population decimated years before
by disease.</p>
<p>Direct Pilgrim influence on the religious life, the administration
and the courts of the Cape settlements continued
from the earliest beginnings at Sandwich in 1637,
with steadily diminishing strength, until the election of
Thomas Prence of Eastham as Governor of Plymouth Colony
in 1657. Meanwhile the parent settlement itself was
coming under the domination of the Massachusetts Bay
Colony and its Puritan hierarchs. The Plymouth connection
finally lapsed, for all practical purposes, in 1685, when
Plymouth Colony was divided up into Plymouth, Barnstable
and Bristol Counties.</p>
<p>First Cape settlement was in 1637, when a band of
Puritan families from Saugus and Lynn on the North Shore
got permission from the Pilgrim Fathers to migrate to the
precincts of the Plymouth Colony, of which the Cape was a
part. Some Pilgrim families from Duxbury and Plymouth
came along with these first settlers to carve out homesteads
in the Sandwich area.</p>
<p>Next towns to be settled were Yarmouth and Barnstable,
in 1639, an earlier attempt to populate the Mattacheesett
section of what is now Barnstable having failed.</p>
<p>Yarmouth was a direct offshoot of Pilgrim Plymouth,
and prominent among its settlers was Giles Hopkins, son
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
of Stephen Hopkins, who came over with his father on the
Mayflower.</p>
<p>Barnstable, at its inception, was dominated by the personality
of the Rev. John Lothrop, a very strongminded
man of dissident Pilgrim persuasion who, together with fifty
of his parishioners, had once served two years in jail
in England for religious schism. For a time the spirit of controversy
continued in the new Cape Colony, fanned by the
radical views of Marmaduke Matthews, a firebrand Welshman.
But by the time Captain Myles Standish and two
companions came down from Plymouth in 1643 to divide
up the salt hay marshes, cleared farmlands and woods of
Barnstable into legally recorded homesteads, the colony
had settled down and become absorbed with more workaday matters.</p>
<p>Last of the very early Cape Cod towns to be settled
was Eastham in 1644, by a party led by the Rev. John
Mayo, bearer of another of the names later to become famous
on the Cape in its great mercantilist period.</p>
<p>Falmouth, in 1686, fissioned off quite directly from
Plymouth, and was incorporated in 1686, originally under
the name of Succonesset. Harwich officially came into being
in 1694, as an offshoot from Barnstable, and very much
later, in 1803, gave rise to Brewster. Dennis, meanwhile,
had fissioned from Yarmouth in 1794. But by this time
Pilgrim origins and influence were but the dimmest of
memories.</p>
<p>Also influential on the early Cape, after the middle
1650&rsquo;s, were the Quakers, at first persecuted, but eventually
accepted as a manifestly superior kind of people. They, too,
quickly merged during the following century into the Cape
Cod way of life, and became indistinguishable from families
of Pilgrim or Puritan origin.</p>

<h2><span class="small">CHAPTER I</span></h2>
<h3 id="c1">Scrooby: Persecution</h3>
<p>The Pilgrim story may well begin from the period of
the Reformation or the ascendency of the Protestant
Church in England. Previous to 1600 much friction had
existed between the Crown and the Papacy in matters
ecclesiastical and civil. The process of reform however
had been crystalizing during the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
This came to culmination in the establishment of the
English Church (known as the Church of England) as the
official or state church of which the King was to be the
temporal head with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the
spiritual head or primate.</p>
<p>But still there was friction. It was like a house divided
against itself. There were those who could not conscientiously
subscribe to the laws and rituals laid down by the
established church. They were dissenters or non-conformists
and are best described by Bradford as follows: &ldquo;The
one side labored to have the right worship of God and
discipline of Christ established in the Church, according to
the simplicity of the gospel, without the mixture of men&rsquo;s
inventions, and to have and be ruled by the laws of God&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
word, dispensed in those offices and by those officers of
Pastors, Teachers and Elders, etc., according to the
Scriptures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other party endeavored to have episcopal dignity
(after the popish manner) with their large power and jurisdiction
still retained.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: In the subject matter in quotations, the spelling of some words has
been changed to the modern form without otherwise affecting the text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This strained and anomalous situation led to the
founding of the Separatist Church in 1602 in the Old Hall
in Gainsborough, with John Smyth as pastor.</p>
<p>Smyth was highly esteemed by the non-conformist
group. He was a graduate of Cambridge, &ldquo;an eminent man
in his time,&rdquo; and his pastorate at Gainsborough extended
from 1602 until 1606 when he was forced to retire.</p>
<p>The Scrooby fraternity, an off-shoot from Gainsborough,
was presided over by Richard Clyfton as first pastor.
Prominent among the non-conformists at Scrooby were
William Brewster, born in Scrooby in 1560, William Bradford,
born in Austerfield, a village three miles distant, in
1588, and John Robinson, born in Lincolnshire about 1576.
Robinson received orders from the Church of England,
was suspended for non-conformity and later joined the
Congregation at Scrooby where he was made pastor.</p>
<p>This triumvirate became the ruling spirits of the
Scrooby community, Brewster became the Elder of the
Church and later the religious leader of the Plymouth settlement,
of which Bradford became Governor. Robinson,
to whom both looked for inspiration and guidance, was
destined by circumstances to remain in Holland where he
had later been forced to take refuge.</p>
<p>These independent thinkers who firmly asserted their
right to worship according to their belief, were brought
into constant conflict with the constituted authorities of the
Church of England. As Bradford says: &ldquo;This contention
was so great, as neither the honour of God, the common
persecution, nor the mediation of Mr. Calvin and other
worthies of the Lord in those places, could prevail with
those thus episcopally minded, but they proceeded by all
means to disturb the peace of this poor persecuted church,
even so far as to charge (very unjustly and ungodly, yet
prelate like) some of their chief opposers, with rebellion
and high treason....&rdquo; And then regarding their treatment
he says: &ldquo;They could not long continue in any peaceable
condition but were hunted and persecuted on every
side.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>From 1603 when King James I succeeded Elizabeth who
had reigned as Queen during the preceding forty-five
years, conditions grew increasingly worse until as Bradford
continues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing themselves thus molested and that there was
no hope of their continuance there, they resolved to go
into the Low Countries, where they heard was freedom of
religion for all men; as also how sundry from London, and
other parts of the land had been exiled and persecuted for
the same cause, and were gone thither and lived at Amsterdam
and in other places of the land. So after they had
continued together about a year, and kept their meetings
every sabbath, in one place or other, exercising the worship
of God amongst themselves, notwithstanding all the diligence
and malice of their adversaries, they seeing they
could no longer continue in that condition, they resolved
to get over into Holland as they could which was in the
year 1607-1608.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span></h2>
<h3 id="c2">Escape: Holland</h3>
<p><i>The Migration to Holland</i> was not accomplished without
its set-backs and misgivings. In the first place it was unlawful
under an old statute which made emigrating without
authority a penal crime. They were several times
intercepted in their attempt to depart from English soil.
But they were determined in purpose and brave in heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being thus constrained to leave their native country,
their lands and livings, and all their friends and familiar
acquaintance, it was much, and thought marvellous by
many. But to go into a country they knew not, but by
hearsay, where they must learn a new language, and get
their livings they knew not how, it being a dear place, and
subject to the miseries of war,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> it was by many thought an
adventure almost desperate, a case intolerable, and a misery
worse than death; especially seeing they were not
acquainted with trades nor traffic, (by which the country
doth subsist) but had only been used to a plain country
life and the innocent trade of husbandry. But these things
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
did not dismay them, (although they did sometimes trouble
them,) for their desires were set on the ways of God, and
to enjoy his ordinances. But they rested on his providence,
and knew whom they had believed. Yet this was
not all. For although they could not stay, yet were they
not suffered to go; but the ports and havens were shut
against them, so as they were fain to seek secret means
of conveyance, and to fee the mariners, and give extraordinary
rates for their passages. And yet were they oftentimes
betrayed, many of them, and both they and their
goods intercepted and surprised, and thereby put to great
trouble and charge; of which I will give an instance or
two, and omit the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a great company of them purposed to get
passage at Boston, in Lincolnshire; and for that end had
hired a ship wholly to themselves, and made agreement
with the master to be ready at a certain day, and take them
and their goods in, at a convenient place, where they accordingly
would all attend in readiness. So after long waiting
and large expenses, though he kept not the day with
them, yet he came at length, and took them in, in the night.
And when he had them and their goods aboard, he betrayed
them, having beforehand complotted with the
searchers and other officers so to do; who took them and
put them into open boats, and there rifled and ransacked
them, searching them to their shirts for money, yae, even
the women, further than became modesty; and then carried
them back into the town, and made them a spectacle
and wonderment to the multitude, which came flocking
on all sides to behold them. Being thus by the catchpole
officers riffled and stripped of their money, books and
much other goods, they were presented to the magistrates,
and messengers sent to inform the Lords of the Council of
them; and so they were committed to ward. Indeed the
magistrates used them courteously, and showed them what
favor they could; but could not deliver them until order
came from the Council table. But the issue was, that after
a month&rsquo;s imprisonment the greatest part were dismissed,
and sent to the places from whence they came; but seven
of the principal men were still kept in prison and bound
over to the assizes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>In the spring of 1608 another attempt was made to
embark and another Dutch shipmaster engaged. This second
party assembled at a point between Grimsby and
Hull not far from the mouth of the Humber. The women
and children arrived in a small bark which became
grounded at low water and while some of the men on
shore were taken off in the ship&rsquo;s boat they were again
apprehended. And to quote again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But after the first boat-full was got aboard, and she
was ready to go for more, the master espied a great company,
both horse and foot, with bills and guns and other
weapons: for the country was raised to take them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the poor men which were got on board were in
great distress for their wives and children, which they
saw thus to be taken, and were left distitute of their helps,
and themselves also not having a cloth to shift them with,
more than they had on their backs, and some scarce a
penny about them, all they had being on the bark. It drew
tears from their eyes, and anything they had they would
have given to have been on shore again. But all in vain;
there was no remedy; they must thus sadly part; and afterwards
endured a fearful storm at sea, being fourteen days
or more before they arrived at their port; in seven whereof
they neither saw sun, moon, nor stars, and were driven to
the coast of Norway; the mariners themselves often despairing
of life, and once with shrieks and cries gave over
all, as if the ship had been foundered in the sea, and they
sinking without recovery. But when man&rsquo;s hope and help
wholly failed, the Lord&rsquo;s power and mercy appeared for
their recovery; for the ship rose again, and gave the mariners
courage again to manager her; and if modesty
would suffer me, I might declare with what fervent
prayers they cried unto the Lord in this great distress,
(especially some of them,) even without any great
distraction.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Those left ashore were in a pitiable state, women were
left without their husbands and children without their
fathers, their property had been sold in anticipation of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
safe departure and the situation was, for a time at least,
desperate. But a kind Providence intervened and while
their purpose was thus hindered, they finally were united
at Amsterdam. As Bradford states: &ldquo;Notwithstanding all
these storms of opposition, they all got over at length, some
at one time and some at another, and yet met together again,
according to their desires, with no small rejoicing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us pause here a moment and reflect. In our contemplation
of the present and concern for the future, we must
not be unmindful of the past. It was not easy to make final
decision in such matter as permanently breaking away
from homes, relatives and friends, not to mention the material
factors involved. Fortunately however for them and
for us, this devout band was imbued with enduring faith.
Faith fortified by grim determination.</p>
<p>Thus they planned and executed. They left the land of
their nativity. They braved the perils of an unknown
ocean and a still more unknown future that they might
find a refuge free from religious bondage and where they
might worship God according to their conscience. This
they accomplished in the face of almost insurmountable
hardships.</p>
<p>They made concord with the Indians, they builded
homes, they framed laws and agreements in accordance
with the time and the necessity. They established a governmental
process sufficient for their needs, an outgrowth
of the government of their religious life in which decisions
were made by the will of the majority. They paved the
way for future generations. They suffered much. They attained
much. They left a heritage that must not be
sacrificed.</p>
<p>We of today are faced with ominous problems. A re-dedication
to the faith, vision and determination of our
fathers, will be America&rsquo;s salvation.</p>

</div>
<h2><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span></h2>
<h3 id="c3">Holland: An Alien Peace</h3>
<p>They remained in Amsterdam about a year when for
both material and spiritual reasons they decided to move
to Leyden 22 miles distant. They had come into some contention
with the church that had established itself before
them which seemed difficult to settle to their satisfaction
and their means of livelihood had become so restricted
that they were threatened with poverty. &ldquo;For these and
some other reasons they removed to Leyden, a fair and
beautiful city. But being now here pinched, they fell to
such trades and employments as they best could, valuing
peace and their spiritual comfort above any other riches
whatsoever; and at length they came to raise a competent
and comfortable living, but with hard and continual
labor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h3 id="c4">The Final and Historic Decision</h3>
<p>Some eleven or twelve years were spent in Leyden
where they enjoyed &ldquo;much sweet and delightful society
and spiritual comfort together, in the ways of God, under
the able ministry and prudent government of Mr. John
Robinson and Mr. William Brewster, who was an assistant
unto him in the place of an Elder, unto which he was now
called and chosen by the church; so as they grew in knowledge
and other gifts and graces of the spirit of God; and
lived together in peace, and love, and holiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet while they seemed to have more spiritual freedom
and to have enjoyed the society of their Dutch neighbors
and had established a good credit among them, they were
confronted with the fear of final absorption in an alien
country. They preferred to maintain their language and
traditions as English men and women. Moreover, King
James was beginning to exercise an unwarrantable influence
in the Low Countries. This went to the extreme of
confiscating their types<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> and presses and the suppression
of the religious matter printed and issued by William
Brewster, the Elder of the Leyden congregation. A compelling
force seemed to drive them on to seek some place
of permanent settlement. And to quote from Bradford:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although the people generally bore all their difficulties
very cheerfully and with a resolute courage, being in the
best of their strength, yet old age began to come on some
of them; and their great and continual labors, with other
crosses and sorrows, hastened it before the time; so as it
was not only probably thought, but apparently seen, that
within a few years more they were in danger to scatter
by necessity pressing them, or sink under their burdens,
or both; and therefore, according to the divine proverb,
that &lsquo;a wise man seeth the plague when it cometh, and
hideth himself,&rsquo; so they, like skilful and beaten soldiers,
were fearful either to be entrapped or surrounded by their
enemies, so as they should neither be able to fight nor
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
fly; and therefore thought it better to dislodge betimes to
some place of better advantage and less danger, if any
could be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lastly (and which was not the least,) a great hope and
inward zeal they had of laying some good foundation, or at
least to make way thereunto, for the propagating and advancing
the Gospel of the kingdom of Christ in these
remote parts of the world; yea, though they should be but
as stepping-stones unto others for performing of so great
a work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place they had thoughts on were some of those
unpeopled countries of America, which are fruitful and
fit for habitation, being devoid of all civil inhabitants,
where there are only savage and bruitish people, which
range up and down little otherwise than the wild beasts.
This proposition being made public, and coming to the
scanning of all, it raised many variable opinions amongst
men, and caused many fears and doubts amongst themselves.
Some from their reasons and hopes conceived, labored
to stir up and encourage the rest to undertake and prosecute
the same; others again, out of their fears, objected
against it, and sought to divert from it, alleging many
things, and those neither unreasonable nor unprobable: as
that it was a great design, and subject to many inconceivable
perils and dangers; as, besides the casualties of the
seas, (which none can be freed from,) the length of the
voyage was such as the weak bodies of women and other
persons worn out with age and travail, (as many of them
were,) could never be able to endure; and yet if they
should, the miseries of the land which they should be exposed
unto would be too hard to be borne, and likely,
some or all of them, to consume and utterly to ruinate
them. For there they should be liable to famine, and nakedness,
and the want, in the manner, of all things.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was answered, that all great and honorable actions
were accomplished with great difficulties, and must be both
enterprised and overcome with answerable courages. It
was granted the dangers were great, but not desperate, and
the difficulties were many, but not invincible; for although
there were many of them likely, yet they were not certain.
It might be that some of the things feared might never
befall them; others, by providence, care and use good of
means, might in a great measure be prevented; and all of
them through the help of God, by fortitude and patience,
might either be borne or overcome. True it was that such
attempts were not to be made and undertaken but upon
good ground and reason, not rashly or lightly, as many
have done for curiosity or hope of gain, etc. But their condition
was not ordinary. Their ends were good and honorable,
their calling lawful and urgent, and therefore they
might expect a blessing of God in their proceeding; yea,
although they should lose their lives in this action, yet they
might have comfort in the same; and their endeavours
would be honorable.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;They lived here but as men in exile and in a poor
condition; and as great miseries might possibly befall them
in this place; for the twelve years of truce were now out,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>
and there was nothing but beating of drums and preparing
for war, the events whereof are always uncertain. The
Spaniard might prove as cruel as the savages of America,
and the famine and pestilence are sore here and there, and
their liberty less to look out for remedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After many other particular things answered and alleged
on both sides, it was fully concluded by the major
part to put this design in execution, and to prosecute it
by the best means they could.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<h2><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span></h2>
<h3 id="c5">London: Preparation</h3>
<p>The coast of North America was not entirely unknown.
There had been several attempts at settlement and exploration.
One by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584. He had taken
possession under a patent confirmed by act of Parliament,
of the territory from the Carolinas north to Virginia, the
name Virginia being given the new country in honor of the
Virgin Queen.</p>
<p>In 1606 another party under command of Capt. John
Smith sailed in three small vessels under authority of a
charter granted by James I. They landed at a point in
Chesapeake Bay, thirty-two miles from the mouth of the
James river in Virginia and established a settlement called
Jamestown.</p>
<p>In 1614 Smith made a voyage to the North Virginia coast
at which time he made a comprehensive map calling this
section New England. Upon his return to England he
showed this map to Charles I, then a prince, who in applying
the names of English towns to points along the coast
gave the place which was to become the Pilgrim settlement
the name of Plymouth, which it has since retained.</p>
<p>There were many matters of moment to be settled
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
before the Pilgrims could depart their native shores. The
liquidation of what property they had acquired was to be
augmented by further financing. It was necessary to obtain
a patent to any land they might acquire for settlement and
the matter of how many and who should go first had to be
determined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those that stayed, being the greater number, required
the pastor to stay with them; and indeed for other reasons
he could not then well go, and so it was the more easily
yielded unto. It was also agreed on by mutual consent
and covenant that those who went should be an absolute
church of themselves, as well as those that stayed, seeing
in such a dangerous voyage, and a removal to such a
distance, it might come to pass that they should (for the
body of them) never meet again in this world. Yet with
this proviso, that if any of the rest came over to them, or of
the other returned upon occasion, they should be reputed
as members without further admission or testimonial. It
was also promised to those that went first, by the body of
the rest, that if the Lord gave them life and means, and
opportunity, they should come to them as soon as they
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next step was to secure a patent. Already letters-patent
had been granted two companies of Englishmen to
territory 100 miles in width on the Atlantic coast of North
America from the 34th to the 45th degrees north latitude.
These were designated as the South and North Virginia
companies. Through emissaries sent to England a patent
was obtained bearing date of Feb. 12th, 1620. This patent
was issued to John Pierce and Associates and covered territory
in the vicinity of the Virginia Capes. As it happened
the Pilgrims settled outside the limits defined therein and
another patent was granted covering the territory around
Cape Cod Bay. This patent bears the date of June 1st, 1621,
and was issued by the Council of New England which had
been created by royal authority to succeed the North Virginia
Company after the departure of the Pilgrims from
England.</p>
<p>It shows the signatures of the Duke of Lenox, the
Marquis of Hamilton, the Earl of Warwick, Lord Sheffield
and Sir Ferdinand Gorges. Several parts of this ancient
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
document have broken away, including the seal of Hamilton
and the seal and signature of John Pierce, the party of the
second part thereto. This valuable document, the oldest
state document in New England, was brought over in the
Fortune in 1621 and now reposes in Pilgrim Hall.</p>
<p>Arrangements were concluded with a group of London
business men who styled themselves the Merchant Adventurers
who were in sympathy with the movement and who
had agreed to finance the expedition. Perhaps they are
best described by Capt. John Smith who wrote in 1624:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The adventurers which raised the stock to begin and
supply this plantation, were about seventy, some gentlemen,
some merchants, some handicraftsmen, some adventuring
great sums, some small, as their estates and their
affection served. These dwelt most about London. They
are not a corporation, but knit together by a voluntary combination
in a society without constraint or penalty, aiming
to do good and to plant religion.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c6">Articles of Agreement</h3>
<p>The Articles of Agreement entered into with the Merchant
Adventurers were as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. The adventurers and planters do agree, that every
persons that goeth, being aged sixteen years and upward,
be rated at ten pounds, and ten pounds to be accounted a
single share.</p>
<p>2. That he that goeth in person, and furnisheth himself
out with ten pounds, either in money or other provisions,
be accounted as having twenty pounds in stock, and in the
division shall receive a double share.</p>
<p>3. The persons transported and the adventurers shall
continue their joint stock and partnership together the
space of seven years, (except some unexpected impediments
do cause the whole company to agree otherwise,)
during which time all profits and benefits that are got, by
trade, traffic, trucking, working, fishing, or any other means,
of any person or persons, shall remain in the common stock
until the division.</p>
<p>4. That at their coming there they choose out such a
number of fit persons as may furnish their ships and boats
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
for fishing upon the sea; employing the rest in their several
faculties upon the land, as building houses, tilling and
planting the ground, and making such commodities as shall
be most useful for the colony.</p>
<p>5. That at the end of the seven years, the capital and
profits, viz., the houses, lands, goods and chattels, be equally
divided among the adventurers and planters; which done,
every man shall be free from other of them of any debt or
detriment concerning the adventure.</p>
<p>6. Whosoever cometh to the colony hereafter, or
putteth any into the stock, shall at the end of the seven
years be allowed proportionally to the time of his so doing.</p>
<p>7. He that shall carry his wife and children or servants,
shall be allowed for every person now aged 16 years and
upward, a single share in the division; or if he provide them
necessaries, a double share, or if they be between 10 years
old and 16 then two of them to be reckoned for a person,
both in transportation and division.</p>
<p>8. That such children as now go and are under the age
of 10 years, have no other share in the division, but 50 acres
of unmanured land.</p>
<p>9. That such persons as die before the seven years be
expired, their executors to have their part or share at the
division, proportionally to the time of their life in the
colony.</p>
<p>10. That all such persons as are of this colony are to
have their meat, drink, apparel and all provisions out of
the common stock and goods of the said colony.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c7">False Accusations</h3>
<p>It has been declared by some commentators that this
agreement savored of communism. This interpretation is
however unfair. As a matter of record it was not entirely
satisfactory to the colonists but was imposed upon them by
the Merchant Adventurers who, looking to the final liquidation
of their advancements, preferred to hold the community
as a whole to meet the obligation. Several letters
written by Robert Cushman to his associates in Leyden
tend to substantiate this view and emphasize that he had
made the best possible terms under the circumstances.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Pertinent to the foregoing it is interesting to quote from
Young&rsquo;s Chronicles, page 84, as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;There is no
foundation for this charge. The Plymouth people were not
&lsquo;misguided by their religious theories,&rsquo; nor influenced by
an &lsquo;imitation of the primitive Christians,&rsquo; in forming their
joint stock company. They entered into this hard and disadvantageous
engagement with the Merchant Adventurers
not voluntarily, but of necessity, in order to obtain shipping
for transporting themselves to America; and they put their
own little property into a common fund in order to purchase
provisions for the voyage. It was a partnership that was
instituted, not a community of goods, as that phrase is commonly
understood.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c8">The Embarkation</h3>
<p>A small vessel of about sixty tons called the Speedwell
and commanded by Captain Reynolds was secured in
Holland and another, somewhat larger, the Mayflower,
of London, commanded by Captain Jones. The
Speedwell left Delft-Haven in July, 1620, with a company of
thirty, including William Bradford, William Brewster,
John Carver, Edward Winslow, Isaac Allerton, Samuel
Fuller and John Howland. Captain Myles Standish was also
a member of the company although not of the congregation.
He was a soldier whose value to the Colony proved
outstanding. They left with the blessing of John Robinson
who intended to follow but whose dreams were never to
be realized.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Dates following accord with the modern calendar except those
marked O.S. indicating Old Style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first party reached Southampton where the Mayflower
awaited them with ninety passengers. On the
fifteenth of August both vessels set sail but had gone but
a short distance when the Speedwell began to leak. They
put back to Dartmouth where eight days were spent in
repairs when the ships again put to sea. They had covered
scarcely three hundred miles when the Speedwell again
began leaking. Both vessels turned back, putting into
Plymouth harbor where the leaking craft was abandoned.
Here eighteen of her passengers decided not to continue.</p>

<p class="pcap">Sighting of Provincetown, showing deck construction of Mayflower type of boat</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c9">Voyage and Arrival</h3>
<p>The Mayflower with its added burden, now numbering
one hundred and two souls, left Plymouth September 16th,
1620, and began its historic journey westward. For a goodly
part of the voyage of over two months duration the ship was
buffeted by equinoctial winds and high seas and, as they
neared the coast, a death is recorded, that of William
Butten, a youth, servant of Samuel Fuller. The records also
disclose the birth of a son, Oceanus, to Stephen and
Elizabeth Hopkins. &ldquo;After long beating at sea they fell
with that land which is called Cape Cod; the which being
made and certainly known to be it, they were not a little
joyful. After some deliberation had amongst themselves
and with the master of the ship, they tacked about and
resolved to stand for the southward (the wind and weather
being fair) to find some place about Hudson River for their
habitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But after they had sailed the course about half the
day, they fell amongst dangerous shols and roaring breakers,
and they were so far entangled therewith as they conceived
themselves in great danger; and the wind shrinking
upon them withall; they resolved to bear up again for the
Cape, and thought themselves happy to get out of those
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
dangers before night overtook them, as by God&rsquo;s providence
they did. And the next day they got into the Cape
Harbor where they rode in safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the 21st of November (present calendar) when
the Mayflower dropped anchor in the sheltered and quiet
waters of Provincetown Harbor and one may well imagine
the happiness and gratitude of these weary voyagers when
they sighted this haven of refuge and were once more
able to place their feet upon dry land. As Bradford records:
&ldquo;Being thus arrived in a good harbor and brought safe to
land, they fell upon their knees and blessed the God of
heaven who had brought them over the vast and furious
ocean, and delivered them from all the perils and miseries
thereof, again to set their feet on the firm and stable earth,
their proper element.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday the 23rd a landing was made, the men to
make repairs to the shallop and the women to wash, thus
establishing Monday as the generally accepted &ldquo;Washday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mayflower Compact was drawn up and signed in
all probability before Mayflower dropped anchor in Provincetown
Harbor. This document was partly the result of
friction that had arisen during the voyage and the intimation
that some among them might exercise their individual
liberty without restraint and against the peace and welfare
of the community as a whole. The text follows with Bradford&rsquo;s
explanatory note:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall a little return back and begin with a combination
made by them before they came ashore, being the
first foundation of their government in this place; occasioned
partly by the discontented and mutinous speeches
that some of the strangers amongst them had let fall from
them in the ship&mdash;That when they came ashore they would
use their own liberty; for none had power to command
them, the patent they had being for Virginia, and not for
New England, which belonged to another Government,
with which the Virginia Company had nothing to do. And
partly that such an act by them done (this their condition
considered) might be as firm as any patent, and in some
respects more sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h3 id="c10">The Compact</h3>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of God, Amen. We whose names are underwritten,
the loyal subjects of our dread sovereign Lord,
King James, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France
and Ireland King, defender of the faith, etc., having undertaken,
for the Glory of God, and advancement of the
Christian faith, and honor of our King and country, a voyage
to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia,
do by these presents solemnly and mutually in the presence
of God, and one of another, covenant and combine
ourselves together into a civil body politic, for our better
ordering and preservation and furtherance of the ends
aforesaid; and by virtue hereof to enact, constitute and
frame such just and equal laws, ordinances, acts, constitutions
and offices from time to time, as shall be thought
most meet and convenient for the general good of the
colony, unto which we promise all due submission and
obedience. In witness whereof, we have hereunder subscribed
our names at Cape Cod, the 11th of November,
in the year of the reign of our sovereign lord, King James
of England, France, and Ireland the eighteenth, and of
Scotland the fifty-fourth. Anno Domino. 1620.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After this they chose, or rather confirmed, Mr. John
Carver (a man godly and well approved amongst them)
their Governor for that year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This meeting, held in the cabin of the Mayflower, is
generally accepted as the first New England town meeting,
although on the 27th of February following, a meeting,
later referred to, was held in the common house for the
purpose of establishing a military guard at which Myles
Standish was chosen captain.</p>
<p>On April 2nd another meeting was held on &ldquo;common
business&rdquo; and at which laws &ldquo;convenient for the common
state&rdquo; were passed.</p>
<p>From these first meetings evolved our present form of
town meeting, held, and elections made, according to the
will of the majority.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Search for Permanent Settlement</h3>
<p>On November 25th, a party of sixteen men under the
leadership of Captain Standish set out on foot looking for a
place for permanent settlement &ldquo;having such instructions
as was thought meet.&rdquo; They had proceeded but a short
distance when they met a small party of Indians who fled
upon approach. They were followed for some miles,
when, darkness coming on, they made camp for the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<div class="sidenote">Nov. 26 to 28</div>
<p>The following day further exploration was made. Some
Indian corn was discovered, also fresh water from which
they drank being sorely in need thereof &ldquo;this
being the first New England water drunk of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning from the vicinity of Truro and
the Pamet River to which their exploration had
taken them, they saw deer and &ldquo;great flocks of wild geese
and ducks, but they were fearful of us.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> Also signs of
Indian habitation and &ldquo;heaps of sand newly padled with
their hands, which they, digging up, found in them divers
fair Indian baskets filled with corn, and some in ears, fair
and good, of divers colors, which seemed to them a goodly
sight (having never seen any such before). So their time
limited to them being expired, they returned to the ship,
lest they should be in fear of their safety; and took with
them part of the corn ... of which on their return they were
marvellously glad....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The days immediately following were occupied in completing
repairs to the shallop, in cutting wood and getting
tools in readiness, in anticipation of a permanent landing.</p>
<p>With this in view a party of thirty set forth on Dec. 7,
&ldquo;for the better discovery of this place.&rdquo; They found signs
of Indian habitation also &ldquo;more of their corn and of their
beans of various colors. The corn and beans they brought
away proposing to give them good satisfaction when they
should meet with any of them (as about 6 months afterward
they did, to their good content).&rdquo; &ldquo;And here it is to be noted
a special Providence of God, and a great mercy to this poor
people that here they got seed to plant them corn the next
year or else they might have starved, for they had none,
nor any likelihood to get any until the season had been
past (as the sequel did manifest).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not finding the desired harborage or place for permanent
settlement this party returned to the Mayflower.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>During their absence and while the Mayflower lay in
the Harbor of Provincetown, a son was born to Susanna
White, wife of William White. He was named Peregrine.</p>
<h3 id="c13">THE SHALLOP ARRIVES AT PLYMOUTH
<br />The Landing</h3>
<div class="sidenote">Wed. Dec. 16</div>
<p>On the sixteenth of December another party set out in
the shallop &ldquo;upon further discovery intending to circulate
that deep bay of Cape Cod.&rdquo; This party consisted
of Myles Standish, John Carver, William
Bradford, Edward Winslow, John Tilley, Edward
Tilley, John Howland, Richard Warren,
Stephen Hopkins, Edward Dotey, John Allerton, Thomas
English, the ship&rsquo;s mates, Mr. Clark and Mr. Coppin, and
the master gunner and three sailors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weather was very cold and it froze so hard as the
spray of the sea lighting on their coats, they were as if
they had been glazed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proceeding as far as Wellfleet they discovered a party of
&ldquo;ten or twelve Indians very busy about a black thing,&mdash;what
it was we could not tell,&mdash;until afterwards they saw
us, and ran to and fro, as if they had been carrying something
away. We landed a league or two from them where
we made us a barricade and got firewood and set out sentinels
and betook us to our lodging, such as it was.&rdquo; This
landing was at Eastham ten miles distant.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Thurs. Dec. 17</div>
<p>When morning came the company was divided, eight
cruising along shore in the shallop while the remainder
explored the land bordering thereon. They
came to the spot &ldquo;where they saw the Indians
the night before and found they had been cutting
up a great fish like a grampus.&rdquo; (small
whale or blackfish).</p>
<p>Nothing of importance having been discovered this day,
they returned to the shallop which had come ashore at
their calling. &ldquo;So being weary and faint,&mdash;for we had eaten
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
nothing all day,&mdash;we fell to make our rendezvous and get
firewood and we fed upon such victuals as we had, and
betook us to our rest, and we had set out our watch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="sidenote">Fri. Dec. 18</div>
<p>In the early morning of the 18th, they had their first
encounter with the Indians &ldquo;some thirty or forty of them,
though some thought that they were many
more.&rdquo; Many arrows were shot but &ldquo;none of
them either hit or hurt us, though many came
close by us and on every side of us and some
coats which hung up in our barricade were shot through
and through.&rdquo; But after several shots were fired at them,
they all left with apparently no casualties. This was the
first actual encounter with the Indians.</p>
<p>During the day the reunited party skirted the coast, the
wind increasing during the afternoon to gale force. The
boat&rsquo;s rudder was broken and the mast split and they were
dependent upon their oars for steering. In this condition
they were driven across the bay toward Saquish where the
high seas prevented landing. By skillful maneuvering
however they managed to round Saquish head and
&ldquo;although it was very dark and rained sore, yet in the end
they got under the lee of a small island,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> and remained
there all the night in safety.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="sidenote">Sat. Dec. 19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, God gave them a morning of comfort and refreshment
for the next day was a fair and sunshiny day and
they found themselves to be on an island secure
from the Indians, where they might dry their
stuff, fix their pieces and rest themselves. And
this being the last day of the week, they prepared
there to keep the Sabbath.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c14">The Historic Landing</h3>
<div class="sidenote">Sun. Dec. 20<br />Mon. Dec. 21</div>
<p>This Sabbath was spent on Clark&rsquo;s Island where they
rested and held service. &ldquo;On Monday they sounded the
harbor and found it fit for shipping, and
marched into the land,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> and found divers
cornfields, and little running brooks, a fit place
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
for situation; at least it was the best they could
find, and the season, and their present necessity,
made them glad to accept it. So they returned
to their ship again with this news to
the rest of their people, which did much comfort
their hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The romance surrounding the Rock that has become
famous in history is not easily discredited. The fact is,
that Elder Thomas Faunce, who was born in Plymouth in
1647 and died in 1746 at the age of ninety-nine years, made
a statement a few years prior to his death, at a time when
removal or covering of the rock was under contemplation,
protesting vigorously at what he considered the desecration
of an object of deep veneration. He stated in the presence
of many hearers that his father, John Faunce, who
came over in the ship Anne, had told him that it was on
that rock that the Pilgrims landed as stated by them to
him. It is further probable that they may have imparted
this information to him directly as a number of the Mayflower
passengers lived for many years subsequent to his
birth.</p>
<p>This information has passed from generation to generation.
&ldquo;Plymouth Rock has now become a symbol of the
Pilgrim venture into the unknown of their day and has
inspired present-day Americans with a new Faith in democracy
and in the American way of living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was during their absence on December 17th, that
Dorothy Bradford, wife of William Bradford, was drowned
in Provincetown harbor.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Fri. Dec. 25<br />Sat. Dec. 26</div>
<p>On the 25th, they set out in the Mayflower for Plymouth,
but the wind being unfavorable, they failed to
make the harbor and put back to Provincetown.
&ldquo;But it pleased God, the next day being Saturday,
the wind came fair, and we put to sea
again and came safely into a safe harbor.&rdquo;
This was the first arrival of the Mayflower at
Plymouth. Sunday was spent on the ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h3 id="c15">A Permanent Settlement</h3>
<p>It is evident that they were favorably impressed both
with the security of the harbor and the general surroundings,
although there was some division of opinion as to the
best location for a permanent settlement as the following
discloses: &ldquo;This bay is a hopeful place, innumerable store
of fowl, skate, cod, turbot and herring we have tasted of;
abundance of muscles, the greatest and best that ever we
saw; crabs and lobsters, in their time infinite.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="sidenote">Mon. Dec. 28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Monday we went aland manned with the master of the
ship and three or four of the sailors. We marched along
the coast in the woods seven or eight miles,
but saw not an Indian nor an Indian house;
only we found where formerly had been some
inhabitants, and where they had planted their
corn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found not any navigable river but four or five
small running brooks of very sweet fresh water, that all
ran into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They speak of the trees, the herbs and the soil, some
sandy and some rich and fertile. They also speak of the
streams that are beginning to fill with fish. That night they
returned to the ship, &ldquo;many being weary with marching.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="sidenote">Tues. Dec. 29</div>
<p>The next day being Tuesday, Dec. 29, the party divided,
some going on foot and some in the shallop. They came to
a creek and &ldquo;went up three English miles, a very
pleasant river<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> at full sea. This place we had a
great liking to plant in, but that it was so far
from our fishing, our principal profit, and so
encompassed with woods that we should be in much danger
of the savages. Some of us, having a good mind for
safety, to plant in the greater isle,<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> we crossed the bay,
which is there five or six miles over. We judged it cold for
our corn and some part very rocky; yet divers thought of
it as a place defensible, and of great security.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night they returned again to the Mayflower determined
to settle the next day on a permanent location.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<div class="sidenote">Wed. Dec. 30</div>
<p>The final selection of a place for settlement is described
as follows: &ldquo;After our landing and viewing of the places,
so well as we could, we came to a conclusion, by most
voices, to set on the main land, on the first place, on a high
ground, where there is a great deal of land cleared, and
hath been planted with corn three or four years ago; and
there is a very sweet brook, runs under the hillside,
and many delicate springs of as good
water as can be drunk, and where we may
harbor our shallops and boats exceeding well;
and in this brook much good fish in their seasons; on the
further side of the river also much corn-ground cleared.
In one field is a great hill, on which we point to make a
platform, and plant our ordinance, which will command
all round about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there we made our rendezvous, and a place for some
of our people, about twenty, resolving in the morning to
come all ashore and to build houses.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="c16">A New Home</h3>
<p>From the foregoing the reader will readily recognize
Coles Hill and Burial Hill and the site of the first fort,
marked now by an appropriate tablet. Also Town Brook
and the adjacent spring which has quenched the thirst of
many a modern day pilgrim as well as residents of this
historic town.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1621 Sat. Jan. 2 to Sat. Jan. 9</div>
<p>During Dec. 31, and Jan. 1, a violent storm prevailed
and it was Saturday, Jan. 2, before work on shore could be
started. In the several days following trees
were felled, timbers shaped, and work begun
on the Common House and the &ldquo;platform&rdquo; or
fort on the hill.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Mon. Jan. 11<br />Mon. Jan. 18</div>
<p>Allotments of land were made, first by taking
notice of &ldquo;how many families there were,
willing all single men that had not wives, to
join with some family as they thought fit, that
so we might build fewer houses; which was
done and we reduced them to nineteen families.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Friday and Saturday being stormy and Jan. 10 being the
Sabbath, work was resumed on Monday, Jan.
11. During this period the greater number
were living on the Mayflower which presumably
anchored in the lower harbor, necessitated
going to and fro and in bad weather seriously interfered
with work on shore. It was on Monday, the 18th,
that Francis Billington made a visit to the
&ldquo;great sea&rdquo; as he thought and which he had
seen from a tree the week previous. This fine
pond of sparkling water &ldquo;full of fish and fowl&rdquo;
thus derived its name Billington Sea.</p>
<p>After some interruptions occasioned by bad weather,
work was again resumed on the 19th. &ldquo;We agreed that
every man should build his own house, thinking by that
course men would make more haste than working in
common.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="sidenote">Tues. Jan. 19 to Fri. Mar. 26</div>
<p>With this end in view work was resumed and &ldquo;we went
to labor that day in the building of our town,
in two rows of houses for more safety. We
divided by lot the plot of ground whereon to
build our town, after the proportion formerly
allotted. The common house in which for the
first we made our rendezvous, being near finished,
wanted only covering, it being only about
twenty foot square. Some should make mortar,
and some gather thatch; so that in four days half of it
was thatched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this period William Bradford was seriously ill
which caused much concern. Two of the colony became
lost in the nearby woods and after a night&rsquo;s exposure to
cold, found their way back in an exhausted condition. Indians
were seen upon several occasions. The roof of the
Common House was set on fire by a spark but fortunately
only the thatch burned. John Goodman was attacked by
&ldquo;two great wolves&rdquo; but succeeded in fighting them off. A
shed was built for common storage. On Sunday, Jan. 31st,
they held their first meeting on land. A heavy wind on
Sunday, Feb. 14th, did some damage to their houses and on
Friday, Feb. 19th, the roof of the little house they had
built for their sick caught fire but no serious damage resulted.
&ldquo;That evening the master going ashore, killed five
geese, which he friendly distributed among the sick
people.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>On Friday, Feb. 26th, a party of twelve Indians were
seen near the plantation and on the same day the tools of
Captain Myles Standish and Francis Cooke, who had been
at work in the woods, were stolen during their absence.</p>
<p>On the morning of the next day, Saturday, Feb. 27th,
a meeting was called, Myles Standish was chosen Captain
and given authority to command in military affairs. Two
Indians were seen on this day &ldquo;upon the top of a hill&rdquo;
(Watson&rsquo;s Hill) but upon the approach of Captain Standish
and Stephen Hopkins, they ran away.</p>
<p>These frequent visitations caused much alarm among
the colonists and &ldquo;caused us to plant our great ordinances
in most convenient places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Saturday, Mar. 13th, they experienced their first
thunderstorm. This occurred in the afternoon following a
day of sunshine and warmth while &ldquo;birds sang in the
woods most pleasantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Mar. 17th, though the weather was
cold, it was fair and they planted their garden seed.</p>
<h3 id="c17">Their Great Losses</h3>
<p>Nothing has been said thus far about the crushing losses
the first winter this little colony sustained through exposure
and disease. Their sufferings must have been well
nigh indescribable, yet history records very little complaint.
William Bradford bore his sufferings with the rest
and it seems fitting to quote here his vivid description:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that which was most sad and lamentable was, that
in two or three months time half of their company died,
especially in January and February, being the depth of
winter, and wanting houses and other comforts, being infected
with the scurvy and other diseases, which this long
voyage and their inaccommodate condition had brought
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
upon them; so as there died sometimes two or three a day,
in the aforesaid time; that of 100 and odd persons, scarce
50 remained. And of these in the time of most distress,
there was but 6 or 7 sound persons, who, to their great
commendations be it spoken, spared no pains, night nor day,
but with abundance of toil and hazard of their own health,
fetched them wood, made them fires, dressed them meat,
made their beds, washed their loathsome clothes, clothed
and unclothed them; in a word did all the homely and
necessary offices for them which dainty and queasy
stomachs cannot endure to hear named; and all this willingly
and cheerfully, without any grudging in the least,
showing herein their true love unto their friends and
brethren. A rare example and worthy to be remembered.
Two of these seven were Mr. William Brewster, their reverend
elder, and Myles Standish, their Captain and military
commander, unto whom myself and many others, were
much beholden in our low sick condition. And yet the
Lord so upheld these persons, as in this general calamity
they were not at all infected either with sickness or lameness.
And what I have said of these, I may say of many
others who died in this general visitation, and others yet
living, that while they had health, yea, or any strength
continuing, they were not wanting to any that had need of
them. And I doubt not but their recompence is with the
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They who died the first winter were buried on Coles
Hill. A fitting memorial now marks the spot.</p>

<p class="pcap">Samoset&rsquo;s Visit</p>
</div>
<h2><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span></h2>
<h3 id="c18">Samoset&rsquo;s Visit</h3>
<div class="sidenote">Fri. Mar. 26</div>
<p>On Friday, Mar. 26, an Indian walked boldly into the
settlement. He saluted them in English and bade them
&ldquo;Welcome.&rdquo; He explained that his home was in
Maine where he had learned some English from
the captains of fishing vessels that frequented
the coast in the vicinity of Monhegan Island,
lying half way between the Penobscot and Kennebec
Rivers and about twelve miles off the
coast. From him they gathered much information. &ldquo;He
discoursed of the whole country and of every province and
of their sagamores and their number of men and strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told us that the place where we now live is called
&lsquo;Patuxet&rsquo; and that about four years ago all the inhabitants
died of an extraordinary plague and there is neither man,
woman nor child remaining, as indeed we have found
none; so there is none to hinder our possession, or lay
claim unto it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night Samoset stayed at the house of Stephen Hopkins
where they &ldquo;watched him,&rdquo; being suspicious of the
scattering bands previously seen. He had told them of
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
another Indian whose name was Squanto, a native of the
place who had been in England and could speak better
English than himself and whom he would later bring with
him.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Sat. Mar. 27</div>
<p>The following day he returned to the Wampanoags
whence he had come. This tribe, with the Nausets, occupied
the territory lying between Narragansett
Bay and Cape Cod. He also spoke particularly
of the Nausets to the southeast who were one
hundred strong while the former numbered
approximately sixty. Massasoit was the Sachem or overlord
of the Indians in the territory stated. It appeared
that the Nausets were much provoked against the English,
having been deceived by a Captain Hunt who &ldquo;got them
under cover of trucking with them, twenty out of this very
place and seven men from the Nausets, and carried them
away and sold them for slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems that the Indian Squanto who was one of the
number had fortunately made his escape and had been
returned through the good offices of certain Englishmen
who were friendly to the colonists.</p>
<p>On Sunday, March 28, Samoset again appeared, bringing
with him five others. They brought with them a few skins
but, it being the Sabbath, no trading was done. However,
they accepted the hospitality of the settlement and &ldquo;did
eat liberally of our English victuals.&rdquo; They also returned
the tools which had been taken from the woods during the
absence of the settlers. That night they departed with a
promise to come again. Samoset, who was reluctant to go,
remained until Wednesday, May 31.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Thur. April 1</div>
<p>On April 1, he returned with Squanto. They reported
that Massasoit, their great sagamore, with his brother
Quadequina was near with all their men. &ldquo;They
could not express well in English what they
would, but after an hour the King came to the
top of a hill (Watson&rsquo;s Hill) over against us
and had in his train sixty men, that we could
well behold them, and they us. We were not willing to
send our governor to them and they were unwilling to come
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Squanto was accordingly sent to confer with them and
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
returned with word that they should send one to &ldquo;parley
with him.&rdquo; Edward Winslow was selected to go that they
might &ldquo;know his mind and signify the mind and will of our
governor which was to have trading and peace with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hostages were exchanged and Captain Standish with
a half dozen armed men met them at the brook (Town
Brook) whence they were &ldquo;conducted to a house then in
building where we placed a green rug and three or four
cushions.&rdquo; Here they were met by the governor and others
and after due felicitations and assurances of friendship
were exchanged, a treaty which may well have marked
the first diplomatic agreement in New England history. It
was faithfully observed by both parties during the reign
of Massasoit and was in force thereafter until the breaking
out of the King Philip War in 1675.</p>
<p>It seems of interest to state here that this outbreak
was instigated by Metacom or Philip as he was called by
the English. He was the youngest son of Massasoit and
had succeeded his brother Wamsutta or Alexander as
head of the Wampanoags. But the recital of that devastating
struggle is not within the sphere of this booklet.
Suffice it to say that it resulted in the practical extermination
of Indians including the Narragansetts, who were
hostile to the white settlers and who for some years had
been a perpetual and growing menace.</p>
<h3 id="c19">The Treaty With Massasoit</h3>
<p>&ldquo;1. That neither he nor any of his, should injure or
do hurt to any of their people.</p>
<p>2. That if any of his did any hurt to any of theirs, he
should send the offender that they might punish him.</p>
<p>3. That if anything were taken away from any of
theirs, he should cause it to be restored; and they should do
the like to his.</p>
<p>4. That if any did unjustly war against him, they would
aid him; if any did war against them, he should aid them.</p>
<p>5. That he should send to his Neighbor-Confederates
to certify them of this that they might not wrong them,
but might be likewise comprised of these Conditions of
Peace.</p>
<p>6. That when his men came to them upon any occasion,
they should leave their bows and arrows behind
them as we should do our pieces when we came to them.</p>
<p>Lastly, that doing thus, King James, their Sovereign
Lord, would esteem him his friend and ally.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap">The Treaty with Massasoit, in its actual setting, &ldquo;an unfinished building&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Early in April John Carver was re-elected governor
and laws and regulations were made for the conduct of
the colony. During this month Governor Carver died. He
had come &ldquo;out of the field very sick, it being a hot day;
he complained greatly of his head and lay down, and
within a few hours his senses failed, so as he never spoke
more until he died. Whose death was much lamented,
and caused great heaviness amongst them as there was
cause. He was buried in the best manner they could,
with some volleys of shot by all that bore arms; and his
wife, being a weak woman, died within 5 or 6 weeks after
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Bradford was chosen governor in his stead,
and not having fully recovered from his recent severe illness,
wherein he had been near the point of death, Isaac
Allerton was chosen to be an assistant &ldquo;unto him who, by
renewed election every year, continued sundry years together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be stated that Bradford was re-elected to the
same office no less than 30 times, for a total term of 33
years&mdash;every year from 1622.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> He was Governor of Plimoth
Colony continuously from 1627-1656 inclusive excepting
for five years when he &ldquo;by importunity gat off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On April 15th, the Mayflower left on her return voyage
to England. During this month the first offence is recorded,
that of John Billington who had defied the authority of
Captain Standish. It seems however that the offence was
more a matter of words or &ldquo;opprobrious speeches&rdquo; than of
deeds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h3 id="c20">The First Marriage</h3>
<div class="sidenote">May 22</div>
<p>The first marriage in the colony took place on the 22nd
of May, that of Edward Winslow to Susanna White,
widow of William White. This marriage was
performed &ldquo;according to the laudable custom
of the Low Countries in which they had lived,
was thought most requisite to be performed
by the magistrate, as being a civil thing, upon which
many questions about inheritances do depend, with other
things most proper to their cognizance and most consonant
to the scriptures (Ruth 4) and nowhere found in the gospel
to be laid on the ministers as a part of their office.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c21">The First Duel</h3>
<div class="sidenote">June 28</div>
<p>What is recorded as the first duel fought in New
England was between Edward Dotey and Edward Leister,
servants of Mr. Hopkins. They fought with
sword and dagger and both were wounded, one
in hand and the other in the thigh. This
was the second offence for which punishment
was invoked by the entire company. It was ordered that
their heads and feet be tied together and to so lie for
twenty-four hours. Their sufferings being great however
they were released by the governor &ldquo;upon their promise
of better carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c22">Winslow and Hopkins Visit Massasoit</h3>
<p>The months of July and August were featured by
several events of interest. On July 12, Edward Winslow
and Stephen Hopkins paid a visit to Massasoit taking with
them clothing and other small gifts which the chieftain
gladly accepted. They learned that the Wampanoags had
been greatly reduced by the plague that had visited them
prior to the coming of the colonists, &ldquo;wherein thousands of
them died, they not being able to bury one another; their
skulls and bones were found in many places, lying still
above aground, where their houses and dwellings had
been, a very sad spectacle to behold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was learned also that the Narragansetts &ldquo;lived but on
the other side of that great bay and were a strong people
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
and many in number, living compact together and had
not been at all touched by this wasting plague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the last of July John Billington, Jr., became lost
in the woods lying to the south of the settlement and was
forced to subsist for several days on berries and whatever
nature afforded. He came in contact with an Indian plantation
below Manomet whence he was conducted to the
Nausets on the Cape. Word reached Massasoit who, in
turn, informed the Plymouth company as to his whereabouts.
A party of ten men was despatched in the shallop
by the Governor and he was located and returned to the
colony apparently none the worse for the experience.</p>
<h3 id="c23">Arrival of Hobamack</h3>
<p>It was about this time that Hobamack, another Indian,
came to live at the settlement. He was a friend of Squanto
and &ldquo;faithful to the English until he died.&rdquo; During a visit
to Nemasket (Middleboro) they came into conflict with a
sachem named Corbitant who was a minor sachem under
Massasoit and who was held to be deceitful both to his
superior and the whites. Hobamack was seized and held
against his will by Corbitant but being of great strength he
broke away making his escape to Plymouth. Fearing that
Squanto might have been killed &ldquo;it was resolved to send
the Captain and 14 men well armed&rdquo; to investigate and to
seek retribution if harm had befallen him. They entered
the house of Corbitant who at the moment was away while
others in attempting to leave against the Captain&rsquo;s orders,
were injured and were later taken to Plymouth
where their injuries were treated to their apparent satisfaction.
Squanto was uninjured and made his way back
to the settlement. Corbitant later explained that his actions
were only in the nature of threats and that he intended no
harm. He also sought the mediation of Massasoit to regain
the friendship of the whites.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Sept. 28</div>
<p>On September 28th a party of ten men with Squanto
for guide and interpreter, set out in the shallop
to explore in and around Massachusetts Bay.
They made friendly contact with the Indians of
the neighborhood and returned with &ldquo;A good
quantity of beaver.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h3 id="c24">The Fortune Arrives</h3>
<div class="sidenote">Nov. 19</div>
<p>On November 19th the Fortune, a vessel of small tonnage,
arrived bringing Robert Cushman and thirty-five
others. They brought practically no provisions except
some clothing but being mostly able-bodied
young men the colony was thus augmented in
man power of which it had been much depleted,
there remaining but fifty of the original colony at this
time. They came to settle permanently and were made
welcome.</p>
<h3 id="c25">Pierce&rsquo;s Attempt Fails</h3>
<p>Let us now step ahead a few months. As the patent to
the lands they now occupied arrived on the Fortune, it is
not irrelevant to mention here the abortive attempt of
John Pierce to get control of the Plymouth colony. On
April 20, 1622, Pierce obtained another patent, superseding
the first, broader in scope and running to himself, his
heirs, associates and assigns forever.</p>
<p>As an evidence of his intention let us quote from a
letter from one of the English company to Governor Bradford&mdash;&ldquo;in
regard he, whom you and we so confidently
trusted, but only to use his name for the company, should
aspire to be lord over us all, and so make you and us
tenants at his will and pleasure, our assurance or patent
being quite void and disannuled by his means.&rdquo; etc. The
adventurers protested in vain and it is further stated that
he demanded &ldquo;500 pounds which cost him but 50 pounds&rdquo;
for the surrender of the patent.</p>
<p>Whether or not this or any sum was paid there seems to
be no record. However the same letter states that &ldquo;with
great trouble and loss we have got Mr. John Pierce to
assign over the grand patent to the company, which he had
taken in his own name and made quite void our former
grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore the records of the Council for New
England which appear in Palfrey&rsquo;s History of New England
furnish the following: &ldquo;Whereas there were several
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
differences between John Pierce citizen and clothmaker of
London and the Treasurer and other the associates of him
the said John Pierce that were undertaken with him for
the settling and advancement of the plantation at Plymouth,
in the parts of New England, said differences, after
the full hearing and debating thereof before us were
finally concluded upon by the offer of the said John Pierce,
and mutual adoption of the said Treasurer and Company
then present, in behalf of themselves and the rest of said
Company, that the said associates with their undertakers
and servants now settled or to be settled in Plymouth
aforesaid should remain and continue tenants unto the
Council established for the managing of the aforesaid
affairs of New England, notwithstanding a grant, bearing
date the 20th of April, 1622, by said Pierce obtained without
the consent of the said associates, from the said Council,
contrary to a former grant to the said Pierce made in
behalf of himself and his said associates dated the 1st of
June, 1621.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the new patent was cancelled and the patent
dated June 1st, 1621, remained in force.

<p class="pcap">A Good Harvest</p>
</div>
<h2><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span></h2>
<h3 id="c26">Preparations for Winter</h3>
<p>The harvest season drawing near, attention was given
to gathering their crops and to putting their houses in
readiness for the approaching winter. While some were
thus engaged others were employed in fishing and their
store of cod, bass and other fish seems to have been plentiful,
for &ldquo;&lsquo;every family had their portion.&rsquo;&rdquo; Of water-fowl,
wild turkeys and venison, there seems, at this time, to
have been an abundance. They had a peck of meal a week
to a person, also Indian corn in like proportion of which
they had planted some twenty acres with six acres of
barley and peas.</p>
<h3 id="c27">The First Thanksgiving</h3>
<div class="sidenote">Nov. 1621</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four
men on fowling, that so we might after a special manner,
rejoice together after we had gathered the
fruits of our labors. These four, in one day,
killed as much fowl as, with a little help
besides, served the company almost a week. At
which time, amongst other recreations, we exercised our
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
arms, many of the Indians coming amongst us, and among
the rest their greatest king Massasoit with some ninety
men, whom for three days we entertained and feasted;<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a>
and they went out and killed five deer, which they brought
to the plantation and bestowed on our governor, and upon
the captain and others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quotations in the few preceding paragraphs are
from Bradford&rsquo;s history, and, more especially from Winslow&rsquo;s
letter to a friend in England. This letter was sent
when the Fortune made its return voyage. It further
stated that since their arrival in the new country in spite
of their reduced numbers, they had succeeded in building
seven dwelling-houses and four for the use of the Plantation;
that they had made friends with the Indians in the
immediate vicinity and that they &ldquo;walked as peacefully
and safely in the woods as in the highways in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is presumable that this letter was inspired, at least
in part by the letter from Mr. Weston which had arrived
with the Fortune. Weston was one of the Adventurers
who had helped to finance the Plymouth colony. His
letter which follows is cold and unsympathetic and according
to both Bradford and Winslow he seems to have
been a man of questionable sincerity as his unsuccessful
attempt to establish a rival colony at Weymouth might
indicate.</p>
<p>Weston&rsquo;s letter said in part:&mdash;&ldquo;That you sent no lading
in the ship is wonderful, and worthily distasted. I know
your weakness was the cause of it, and I believe more
weakness of judgment than weakness of hands. A quarter
of the time you have spent in discoursing, arguing and
consulting, would have done much more. If you mean,
bona fide, to perform the conditions agreed upon, do us
the favor to copy them out fair, and subscribe them with
the principal of your names. And likewise give us account
as particularly as you can how our moneys were laid out.
And consider that the life of the business depends on
the lading of this ship.&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>If Weston had been acquainted with the condition of
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
the Plymouth colony, their great depletion and hardships
the first winter (and it is reasonable to suppose that he was,
upon the return of the Mayflower) his letter seems unnecessarily
harsh and unjust. It was addressed to Mr. Carver,
the news of whose death had not yet reached
England.</p>
<p>Governor Bradford&rsquo;s letter in reply to which he added
an itemized accounting, follows in part. His dignified reproof,
his presentation of conditions obtaining in the
colony, the extenuating circumstances, I think the reader
will agree cannot reasonably be omitted from this brief
chronicle.</p>
<h3 id="c28">Bradford&rsquo;s Letter</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Sir: Your large letter written to Mr. Carver, and dated
the 6 of July, 1621, I have received the 10 of November,
wherein (after the apology made for yourself) you lay
many imputations upon him and us all. Touching him, he
is departed this life, and now is at rest in the Lord from
all those troubles and incumbencies with which we are
yet to strive. He needs not my apology; for his care and
pains were so great for the common good, both ours and
yours, as that therewith (it is thought) he oppressed himself
and shortened his days; of whose loss we cannot
sufficiently complain. At great charges in this adventure,
I confess you have been, and many losses may sustain;
but the loss of his and many other honest and industrious
men&rsquo;s lives, cannot be valued at any price. Of the one,
there may be hope of recovery, but the other no recompence
can make good. But I will not insist in generals but
come more particularly to the things themselves. You
greatly blame us for keeping the ship so long in the
country, and then to send her away empty. She lay 5
weeks at Cape Cod, whilst with many a weary step (after
a long journey) and the endurance of many a hard brunt,
we sought out in the hard winter a place of habitation.
Then we went in so tedious a time to make provision to
shelter us and our goods, about which labor, many of our
arms and legs can tell us to this day we were not negligent.
But it pleased God to visit us then, with death daily, and
with so general a disease, that the living were scarce able
to bury the dead; and the well not in any measure sufficient
to tend the sick. And now to be so greatly blamed, for not
freighting the ship, doth indeed go near us, and much discourage
us. But you say you know we will pretend weakness;
and do you think we had not cause? Yes, you tell us
you believe it, but it was more weakness of judgement than
of hands. Our weakness herein is great we confess, therefore
we will bear this check patiently amongst the rest, till God
send us wiser men. But they which told you we spent so
much time in discoursing and consulting, etc., their hearts
can tell their tongues they lie. They cared not, so they
might salve their own sores, how they wounded others.
Indeed, it is our calamity that we are (beyond expectation)
yoked with some ill-conditioned people, who will never do
good, but corrupt and abuse others, etc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Fortune on her return was overhauled
by French pirates and all her cargo of value taken.
Robert Cushman, who was aboard on his return to England,
later wrote &ldquo;By God&rsquo;s providence we got well home
the 17th<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> of February. Being robbed by the Frenchmen
by the way, and carried by them into France, and were
kept there 15 days and lost all that we had that was worth
taking; but thanks be to God, we escaped with our lives
and ship.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<h2><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span></h2>
<h3 id="c29">Indian Trouble</h3>
<p>After the departure of the Fortune the Plymouth
colony faced a serious situation. Their provisions were not
sufficient to meet the demands of their suddenly increased
numbers and the threat of attack hovered over their little
community.</p>
<p>The Narragansetts were not friendly with Massasoit
and they resented the intrusion of the white settlers. Their
chief Canonicus by way of warning sent a bundle of
arrows wrapped in snake skin to which the Governor
replied by returning the skin with bullets wrapped therein,
together with the admonition that if they would prefer
war to peace, they &ldquo;could begin when they would.&rdquo; They
however took the precaution to strengthen their defences
and the settlement was &ldquo;impaled round by the beginning
of March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Standish had, in the meantime, on advice of
the Governor, divided his small forces into &ldquo;four squadrons
and every one had their quarter appointed unto which
they were to repair upon any sudden alarm. And, if there
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
should be any cry of fire, a company were appointed for a
guard, with muskets, while others quenched the same, to
prevent Indian treachery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1622</div>
<p>In May the Sparrow, a fishing vessel, arrived bringing
seven more passengers. In July two more vessels, the
Charity, and the Swan, belonging to Mr. Weston,
arrived with about sixty men who were
left at the Plymouth settlement. They remained
there through the summer when, upon
the return of one of Weston&rsquo;s ships from Virginia, they
were transferred to Weymouth, their original destination.</p>
<p>These ships had brought the information that Mr.
Weston had withdrawn from the Merchant Adventurers
and had acquired a patent to land in the vicinity of Massachusetts
Bay, that the men sent over were destined therefore,
that they were a rough lot and, according to a letter
from Mr. Cushman &ldquo;were no men for them.&rdquo; They were,
however, as well provided for as the circumstances under
this added burden and their strained supply of provisions
would permit, until their removal to the Weymouth
Colony.</p>
<p>After their departure and when the supply of food
was well nigh exhausted, a fishing vessel came into the
harbor, from which they were able to secure a small
supply of provisions that helped sustain them until the
next harvest. This vessel also brought report of the Indian
massacre in Virginia.</p>
<p>It was during the succeeding weeks that the fort was
built on the hill (Burial Hill). As Bradford says, &ldquo;This
summer they built a fort of good timber both strong and
comely, which was of good defence, made with a flat roof
and battlements on which their ordinance were mounted
and where they kept constant watch, especially in time of
danger. It served them also for a meeting-house and was
fitted accordingly for that use. It was a great work for
them in this weakness and time of wants; but the danger
of the time required it, and both the continual rumors of
the fears from the Indians here, especially the Narragansetts,
and also the hearing of that great massacre in Virginia,
made all hands willing to despatch the same.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>

<p class="pcap">Capt. Standish Slays Pecksuot</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The next harvest turned out to be a poor one owing
partly to their weakened condition and to other necessary
work that they were called upon to do. But again Providence
came to the rescue. Another ship, the Discovery,
Captain Jones (Not Captain Christopher Jones of the Mayflower)
came into the harbor. She had been sent out from
England to &ldquo;discover all the harbors between this and
Virginia and the sholes of Cape Cod and to trade along
the coast where they could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this ship they obtained articles which they in
turn were able to exchange with the Indians for corn
which they sorely needed and for beaver skins to apply to
their obligations to the Adventurers.</p>
<p>The Swan, having been left by Mr. Weston at Weymouth
and the colony there being destitute of provisions,
arrangement was made with the Plymouth Colony to join
them in a trading expedition along the Cape. This was
made under the direction of Governor Bradford who went
with them, taking Squanto as guide. At Chatham Squanto
was stricken with fever and died, wherein they sustained
a great loss. They succeeded in getting &ldquo;about 26 or 28
hogsheads of corn and beans from the Indians,&rdquo; after which
&ldquo;the Governor took a few men and went to the inland
places, to get what he could, and to fetch it home at the
spring, which did help them something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1623</div>
<p>The Plymouth Colony had been warned as to the type
of men who composed the Weymouth Colony. As it turned
out, they were constantly fomenting discord
with the Indians and some even went so far
as betray the friendship of their Plymouth
neighbors. They were repeatedly in want of
food and other supplies although having been at first well
provided.</p>
<p>Bradford states: &ldquo;Many sold their clothes and bed coverings;
others (so base were they) became servants to the
Indians and would cut them wood and fetch them water
for a cap full of corn; others fell to plain stealing, both
night and day from the Indians, of which they grievously
complained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About this time word came that their friend Massasoit
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
was gravely ill. Following the Indian custom, Edward
Winslow, together with one John Hamden, with Hobomock
for guide, went to his aid and through their ministrations
he recovered.</p>
<p>From Massasoit they learned of the conspiracy among
the Indians which had spread to the Cape Indians and
which he had been unable to stop. This conspiracy engendered
by the treatment of the Indians by the Weston
colony provided that the colony should be wiped out and
that the Plymouth colony being likely to seek revenge,
should also be exterminated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He advised them therefore to prevent it, and that
speedily, by taking of some of the chief of them, before
it was too late, for, he assured them of the truth thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon, this news reaching Plymouth, Captain
Myles Standish set out with eight men for Weymouth
where he &ldquo;found them in miserable condition.&rdquo; The Indians
were openly defiant and insulting. The meeting resulted
in the killing of several Indians including a large
brave named Pecksuot whom Captain Standish killed in
hand to hand combat. Those who remained of the Weston
colony thought it best to take their leave and in the Swan
sailed away for the fishing grounds off the coast of Maine
provisioned with corn from the scanty store remaining
with Standish. Thus the Weston colony came to end.</p>
<p>Weston returning later, fell into the hands of the Indians
who stripped him of his belongings and reduced
him to such extent that he appealed to the Plymouth
Colony for help. They gave him a generous supply of
beaver skins which he was able to exchange for supplies
from the other vessels along the coast which was &ldquo;the
only foundation for his future course.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap">The First Cattle</p>
</div>
<h2><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span></h2>
<h3 id="c30">Consolidation</h3>
<p>Again the colony was facing a shortage of food and
ways and means were discussed for raising larger and
better crops. This brought about a change of the policy
which had been imposed upon them in the last clause of
their contract with the Merchant Adventurers. It was a
practical repudiation of a policy that destroyed individual
initiative. It is expressed in Bradford&rsquo;s own words as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;So they began to think how they might raise
as much corn as they could and obtain a better crop than
they had done. At length, after much debate of things,
the Governor (with the advice of the chief amongst them)
gave way that they should set corn every man for his own
and in that regard, trust to themselves. And so assigned
to every family a parcel of land according to a proportion
of their number for that end. This had very good success,
for it made all hands very industrious, so as much more
corn was planted than otherwise would have been. The
women now went willingly into the field, which before
would allege weakness and inability; whom to have compelled,
would have been thought great tyranny and
oppression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The experience that was had in this common course
and condition, tried sundry years, and that amongst godly
and sober men, may well evince the vanity of that conceit
of Plato and other ancients, applauded by some of later
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
time; that the taking away of property and bringing in
community into a commonwealth, would make them happy
and flourishing as if they were wiser than God. For this
community was found to breed much confusion and discontent
and retard much employment that would have
been to their benefit and comfort. For the young men
that were most able and fit for labor and service did
repine that they should spend their time and strength to
work for other men&rsquo;s wives and children without any recompence.
The strong had no more of victuals and clothes
than he that was weak and not able to do a quarter the
other could; this was thought injustice. The aged and graver
men to be ranked and equalized in labor, victuals and
clothes, etc., with the younger, thought it some indignity
and disrespect unto them. And for men&rsquo;s wives to be commanded
to do service for other men, as dressing their
meat, washing their clothes, etc., they deemed it a kind of
slavery, neither could many husbands well brook it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this way provision was made for their future needs,
as &ldquo;God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c31">Arrival of Anne and Little James</h3>
<p>In the summer of 1623 two vessels arrived, the Anne
and the Little James. They brought about a hundred
additional members to the Plymouth Colony, some being
the wives and children of those already here. The Anne
the larger vessel, having been chartered by the Adventurers,
returned on September 20th, laden with clapboards
and beaver. &ldquo;Mr. Winslow was sent over with her to
inform of all things, and procure such things as were
thought needful for their present condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the period before the harvest, the enlarged
community subsisted mainly upon fish and shell fish, the
latter apparently being in abundance. The one boat was
used in turn by different groups that all might share in the
labor in proportion to their number. An occasional deer
made a welcome addition to their larder, and, as those who
had lately arrived had brought provisions sufficient to
sustain themselves, they were able to carry on until the
new harvest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>This was evidently an abundant one, for as Bradford
describes it; &ldquo;By this time harvest was come, and instead
of famine, now God gave them plenty, and the face of
things was changed, to the rejoicing of the hearts of many,
for which they blessed God. And the effect of their particular
planting was well seen, for all had, one way and
other, pretty well to bring the year about, and some of
the abler and more industrious had to spare, and sell to
others, so as any general want or famine has not been
amongst them since to this day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1624</div>
<p>The harvest under the new conditions having proved
a success it was followed by an equal division of land.
&ldquo;And to every person was given only one acre
of land, to them and theirs, as near the town as
might be and they had no more until the
seven years had expired. The reason was that
they might be kept close together both for more safety
and defence, and the better improvement of the general
employments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early this year, the time of election of officers having
arrived and the members of the colony having increased,
it was considered advisable to provide more assistance to
the Governor. &ldquo;The issue was, that as before there was but
one assistant, they now chose 5, giving the Governor a
double voice; and afterwards they increased them to 7,
which course hath continued to this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spring Edward Winslow returned from England.
His mission had two objectives, viz., to acquaint the Merchant
Adventurers with the exact condition of the Plymouth
Colony, their progress and their needs and to obtain
certain necessary supplies. He reported dissension among
the English company as a result of which, one faction sent
over a Mr. Lyford who with one John Oldham, who had
come over in the Anne, attempted to create an unfavorable
impression in their report to the Adventurers. Letters
of Oldham were intercepted, and, faced with the proof of
their duplicity, which they couldn&rsquo;t deny, they were forced
to leave the colony.</p>
<p>A ship-carpenter arriving on the ship with Mr. Winslow,
proved of great value. He had completed the building of
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
several small craft when he was stricken with fever. Bradford
says of him: &ldquo;He quickly built them 2 very good and
strong shallops (which after did them great service) and a
great and strong lighter, and had hewn timber for 2 catches;
but that was lost, for he fell into a fever and though he had
the best means the place could afford, yet he died.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c32">The First Cattle</h3>
<p>An important acquisition to the colony was brought
over by Mr. Winslow. This consisted of three heifers and
a bull, &ldquo;the first beginning of any cattle of that kind in
the land.&rdquo; Of the increment of this small herd, mention is
made later.</p>
<p>Mr. Winslow, who had gone back to England in the fall
of 1624 now returned. He brought a letter from some of
their friends in the English company to the effect that the
company was dissolved and that the agreement by which
they were sharers and partners was no longer in effect and
that ways and means should be devised whereby their
advancements would be secured. This letter states: &ldquo;Now
we think it but reason, that all such things that there
appertain to the general, be kept and preserved together
and rather increased daily, than anyway be dispersed, and,
after your necessities are served, you gather together such
commodities as the company yields and send them over to
pay debts and clear engagements here, which are not less
than 1400 pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two vessels had been sent over to expedite their settlement.
The larger a cargo of dried fish, but because there
was threat of war with France the master &ldquo;neglected
(through timerousness) his order and put first into Plymouth
and after into Portsmouth.&rdquo; This was much to their
loss for the cargo &ldquo;would have yielded them (as such fish
was sold that season) 1800 pounds, which would have
enriched them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smaller vessel, the Little James, (before mentioned)
with a cargo of 700 lbs. of beaver skins, was captured by a
Turkish man-of-war.</p>
<p>Captain Standish had left on the larger vessel with
letters and instructions to arrange with the Council of
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
New England and those of the company &ldquo;which still clave
to them&rdquo; for easier terms in their purchase of supplies
and future transactions. They had sustained heavy losses
although there were some redeeming offsets as: &ldquo;after
harvest this year, they sent out a boat&rsquo;s load of corn 40
or 50 degrees to the eastward up a river called Kenebeck
(Kennebec); it being one of those two shallops which their
carpenter had built them the year before. God preserved
them and gave them good success for they brought home
700 lbs. of beaver besides some other furs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1626</div>
<p>In April Captain Standish returned bringing news of
the death of their former pastor, John Robinson, also that
of Robert Cushman who had been active in
the affairs of the colony. The year thus had a
cloudy beginning. They had been unsuccessful
in their fishing enterprises and had turned to the
intensive cultivation of corn which not only served them
as a food staple but as a medium of exchange, as money
they had little of.</p>
<p>At a time when they were in need of equipment to carry
on their work to the best advantage, they heard that a
plantation at Monhegan, owned by a Plymouth (England)
company, of Merchants, was to &ldquo;break up and divers useful
goods sold.&rdquo; Whereupon Governor Bradford and Mr. Winslow
&ldquo;took a boat and some hands and went thither.&rdquo;
These goods they bought in part with another party. They
also acquired a &ldquo;parcel of goats which they distributed at
home as they saw need and occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They also obtained some rugs and other commodities
from a French ship that had been cast away on the coast,
all of which added to their material comfort.</p>
<p>They had been paying a high rate of interest to the
English company and they &ldquo;sent Mr. Allerton into England
to make a composition upon as good terms as he could
(unto which some way had been made the year before by
Captain Standish) but yet enjoined him not to conclude
absolutely until they knew the terms.&rdquo; They also gave
him a commission to secure further supplies for the
colony.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1627</div>
<p>Mr. Allerton returned from England with the needed
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
supplies, also the agreement which he had affected with
the remaining members of the English company. The
essence of this agreement was that upon the
payment of 1800 pounds, in yearly installments
of 200 pounds, the Plymouth Colony would be
relieved of their obligations. While this was approved by
&ldquo;all the plantation and consented unto&rdquo; it was actually assumed
by seven or eight &ldquo;in behalf of the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second allotment of land was made in January of
this year, on the basis of first, that the original allotment
wherein one acre was given to every person, should stand,
and, second, that this, the second division, &ldquo;should consist
of twenty acres to every person, and to contain five in
breadth and four in length; and so accordingly to be divided
by lot, to every one which was to have a share therein.&rdquo;
There followed several provisions, one to the effect &ldquo;that
fowling, fishing and hunting be free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In May a division of cattle was made from the three
cows and bull brought over in 1624 there had been a substantial
increase &ldquo;which arose to this proportion: a cow
to six persons or shares, and two goats to the same, which
were first equalized for age and goodness and then allotted
for; single persons consorting with others, as they
thought good and smaller families likewise; and swine
though more in number, yet by the same rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Allerton was again sent to England with power
to conclude the contract previously alluded to, with certain
provisions. These provisions, while still obligating &ldquo;William
Bradford, Captain Myles Standish, Isaac Allerton,
etc.&rdquo; in the performance thereof, gave them a tangible
means of securing themselves. They also sent &ldquo;what
beaver skins they could spare to pay some of their engagements
and to defray his charge.&rdquo; He was also authorized
to &ldquo;procure a patent for a fit trading place in the
river of Kenebeck.&rdquo; He was to express further the
hope that their friends in Leyden might join them, in
which case &ldquo;they should thankfully accept of their love
and partnership herein.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1628</div>
<p>Early in the spring of 1628 Mr. Allerton returned with
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
the report that he had effected an arrangement whereby:
&ldquo;William Bradford, Governor of Plymouth in N. E., in
America, Isaac Allerton, Myles Standish, William
Brewster and Ed. Winslow of Plymouth,
aforesaid, merchants, do by these presents for
us and in our names, make, substitute and appoint James
Sherley, Goldsmith, and John Beachamp, Salter, citizens of
London, our true and lawful agents, factors, substitutes
and assignees,&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>
<p>He also brought a &ldquo;reasonable supply of goods for the
plantation and without those great interests as before is
noted.&rdquo; And he &ldquo;had settled things in a good and hopeful
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had obtained a patent for a trading post at Kennebec,
&ldquo;but it was so ill bounded, as they were fain to renew
and enlarge it the next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It developed that Mr. Allerton had been taking advantage
of his opportunity in his visits to England, to trade
on his own account thus acquiring the profit that should by
right, go to the company. These transactions were first
overlooked for he had been of &ldquo;good and faithful service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About this time trading was inaugurated with the
Dutch of New Amsterdam who had previously approached
the Plymouth colony with that end in view. It was during
this period that wampum was developed, both as a commodity
and as a medium of exchange.</p>
<h3 id="c33">The Wollaston Incident</h3>
<p>The life of the colony was broken by some disquieting
incidents. From the settlements at Wollaston (now a
part of Quincy) came reports of trouble. Captain Wollaston,
the founder of this colony, had departed for Virginia
with some of his retainers, leaving one Fitcher to govern
in his place. Among those of his party left behind was a
Thomas Morton who, &ldquo;having more craft than honesty,
persuaded them to &lsquo;thrust out Fitcher.&rsquo;&rdquo; Whereupon, &ldquo;they
fell to great licentiousness and Morton became lord of
misrule and maintained (as it were) a school of Atheism.&rdquo;
They erected a Maypole around which they drank and
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
danced. They furnished firearms to the Indians and the
means of moulding shot; they danced and caroused, inviting
Indian women for their consorts. This went on until
the more ordered among them appealed to Plymouth to
&ldquo;suppress Morton and his consorts before they grew to
further head and strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two letters of remonstrance to Morton having been
received with insolence and defiance, Captain Standish
was called into action and proceeded with some others to
take Morton by force. This they did after a show of resistance.
He had &ldquo;made fast his doors, armed his consorts,
set divers dishes of powder and bullets ready on the table;
and, if they had not been over armed with drink, more
hurt might have been done. At length, fearing that they
would do some violence to the house, he and some of his
crew came out, not to yield but to shoot. But they were so
steeled with drink their pieces were too heavy for them
and one was so drunk that he ran his nose upon the point
of a sword.&rdquo; Morton was taken to Plymouth and later sent
to England, together with a report of his conduct to the
Council of New England.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1629</div>
<p>In 1629 the colony received thirty-five additional members
from the Leyden Congregation. They arrived with
John Endicott and his company at Salem on the
ship Mayflower (not the same Mayflower that
had brought the Pilgrims to Plymouth). A
charter had been granted to Endicott for territory in and
around Massachusetts Bay. A letter came at this time
from John Sherley addressed to Governor Bradford to the
effect that &ldquo;Mr. Beachamp and myself, with Mr. Andrews
and Mr. Hatherly, are, with your love and liking, joined
partners with you.&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>On the 13th of January of this year a patent was
granted to William Bradford and Associates. This enlarged
the original grant and included territory on the Kennebec
river where a trading post had already been established.
This patent, bearing the signature of the Earl of Warwick,
was later transferred to the Colony and is now in the
Registry of Deeds at Plymouth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h3 id="c34">The First Settled Minister</h3>
<p>The first settled minister was Ralph Smith, a graduate
of Cambridge University, England, who had come with his
family to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He arrived in
Plymouth in 1629 and served as minister until 1636. He
was succeeded by John Rayner, a graduate of Magdalen
College, who continued his ministry until 1654.</p>
<p>During Mr. Smith&rsquo;s incumbency it is probable that
services were held in both the Fort on Burial Hill and the
Common House on what is now Leyden Street as the first
meeting-house which faced Town Square was not built
until 1637.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1630</div>
<p>In May, 1630, the colony was further augmented by the
arrival of &ldquo;16 or 18&rdquo; more of their Leyden brethren who
had come to Boston with John Winthrop and
his company. These arrivals, while welcome,
increased the financial burden now resting
heavily upon the shoulders of those who had assumed the
obligations.</p>
<h3 id="c35">First Capital Offence</h3>
<p>This year John Billington, the elder who had before
been charged with minor offences, was tried and executed
for murder. &ldquo;He was arraigned by both grand and petit
jury&rdquo; and &ldquo;found guilty of willful murder by plain and
notorious evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c36">Their Obligations Increase</h3>
<p>Having become dissatisfied with the way the affairs of
the colony were being conducted in England, Mr. Winslow
was sent over to effect an accounting while Mr. Allerton
was discharged.</p>
<p>It developed that while the indebtedness of 1800 pounds
previously assumed had been reduced to 1000 pounds,
subsequent transactions engaged in by Mr. Allerton had
increased their obligations by 4700 pounds. While it
appears that Allerton had used the opportunity he enjoyed
for his personal gain, the attitude of the Plymouth Colony
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
toward him was one of generosity as shown by the following:
&ldquo;It is like, though Mr. Allerton might think not to
wrong the plantation in the main, yet his own gain and
private ends led him aside in these things; for it came to
be known, and I have it in a letter under Mr. Sherley&rsquo;s
hand, that in the first 2 or 3 years of his employment, he
had cleared up 400 pounds and put it in a brewhouse in
London, at first under Mr. Shirley&rsquo;s name, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1632</div>
<p>While the colony assumed this added burden of indebtedness,
their income seems to have increased likewise.
&ldquo;The Lord prospered their trading&rdquo; and &ldquo;they
made yearly large returns.&rdquo; Cattle and corn increased
in value and thus encouraged &ldquo;there
was no longer holding them together, but now
they must of necessity, go to their great lots; they could not
otherwise keep their cattle, and, having oxen grown, they
must have land for plowing and tillage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The influx into the Massachusetts Bay colony gave impulse
to this movement and to the increase in the price of
cattle and products of the plantations. It resulted in the
establishments of settlements where the quality of the soil
encouraged cultivation. Thus the nucleus of future towns
began to appear with separate places of worship, in the territory
both to the north and south of Plymouth.</p>
<h3 id="c37">Roger Williams</h3>
<div class="sidenote">1633</div>
<p>Roger Williams, who had come from the Massachusetts
Bay colony to Plymouth, was born in Wales and matriculated
at Pembroke College, Cambridge. Historians
differ somewhat as to his teachings and
practice. Perhaps Bradford understood him best.
Let him speak: &ldquo;Mr. Roger Williams (a man
godly and zealous, having many precious parts, but very
unsettled in judgment) came over first to Massachusetts,
but upon some discontent, left the place and came hither
(where he was friendly entertained, according to their poor
ability) and exercised his gifts amongst them, and after
some time was admitted a member of the church: and his
teaching well approved, for the benefit whereof I still bless
God, and am thankful to him, even for his sharpest admonitions
and reproofs, so far as they agree with truth. He this
year began to fall into some strange opinions, and from
opinion to practice; which caused some controversy between
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
part, by occasion whereof he left them something abruptly.&rdquo;
etc.</p>
<h3 id="c38">Winslow Elected Governor</h3>
<p>This year Edward Winslow was elected Governor. He
was re-elected in 1634-1636-1638-1644, William Bradford
serving from 1621 until his death in 1657 with the exception
of these five years.</p>
<p>Trading was now begun on the Connecticut river and a
post established there.</p>
<p>The Colony was attacked by an epidemic which took
over twenty lives, including that of Samuel Fuller, their
physician and surgeon who &ldquo;had been a great help and
comfort to them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="sidenote">1636</div>
<p>In 1636 owing to the growth of the original plantation
and the establishments of separate settlements at Scituate
and Duxbury, the purely democratic rule which
had obtained under the Mayflower Compact,
wherein matters pertaining to the interests of
the colony were settled in general assembly,
was superseded by a law passed providing for government
by deputies representing the several towns.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1639</div>
<p>In 1639 the first legislative body brought together representatives
from the towns of Sandwich, Barnstable,
Yarmouth, Taunton, Scituate, Duxbury
and Plymouth. Thus we have representative government
in its formative state.</p>
<h3 id="c39">Boundaries Established</h3>
<div class="sidenote">1640</div>
<p>In 1640 the boundaries of the Plymouth and Massachusetts
Bay colonies were established. In the several patents
there had been some overlapping of territory.
This resulted in considerable controversy. &ldquo;The
Court of Massachusetts appointed some to range
their lines according to the bounds of their patent, and
(as they went to work) they made it to take in all Scituate
and I know not how much more. Again, on the other hand,
according to the line of the patent of this place, it would
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
take in Hingham and much more within their bounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After much discussion it was finally settled on the
9th of April and subscribed to by William Bradford and
Edward Winslow for Plymouth and John Endicott and Israell
Stoughton for Massachusetts Bay.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1643</div>
<p>The death of William Brewster occurred early in 1643.
Bradford speaks of him in endearing terms: &ldquo;I am to begin
this year with that which was a matter of great
sadness and mourning unto them all. About
the 18th of April died my dear and loving
friend, Mr. William Brewster, a man who had
done and suffered much for the Lord Jesus and the gospels
sake and had borne his part in well and woe with this poor
persecuted church above 36 years, in England, Holland
and in this wilderness and done the Lord and them faithful
service in his place and calling.&rdquo; etc.</p>
<h3 id="c40">New England Confederacy</h3>
<p>Due to the plottings of the Narragansetts and what
seemed to be a general Indian conspiracy against the English
settlers, it was decided to form an alliance with Connecticut
for mutual protection. This is recorded in the
Plymouth records as of June 6th, 1643, as follows: &ldquo;It
is ordered and concluded by the Court that Mr. Edward
Winslow and Mr. William Collyer shall have full Commission
and Authority in Name of the whole Court to
subscribe the Articles of Confederation (now read in the
Court) with the Massachusetts, Connecticut and New
Haven and to subscribe the same in name of the whole
and to affix thereto the common seal of the Government.&rdquo;
(sic.)&mdash;Plymouth records, Hazard&rsquo;s Historical Collection.
Volume 1. p. 496.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter a final liquidation of the obligations
of the Plymouth Colony to their English partners and
associates was effected. This was based upon Articles of
Agreement made and signed on October 15th, 1641,<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> by
&ldquo;John Atwode<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a>
(Atwood), William Bradford, Edward
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
Winslow, etc.&rdquo;&mdash;Page 452, Bradford&rsquo;s History of The Plymouth
Plantation.</p>
<p>In the face of the adversities that had beset them
from the beginning and from which they were never
entirely free, this seems a noteworthy achievement.</p>
<div class="sidenote">1649</div>
<p>In 1649 the Town of Plymouth made choice of &ldquo;seven
discreet men whose duty it was to act in behalf of the
town in disposing of lands; to make inquiry
into the state and condition of the poor, to
provide for their comfortable support and to
find them employment; to direct to the proper means of
relief for the aged and decrepid; and to attend to the
affairs of the town generally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foregoing together with a law passed in 1665 extended
the functions of the board, &ldquo;a group which may
well have been the forerunner of our present Board of
Selectmen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c41">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It would be interesting to follow in detail the development
of the Plymouth Colony and its gradual transition
from the primitive settlement to the flourishing shire town
of the county. But this is a Pilgrim story and the writer
bows to the limitations of time and space.</p>
<p>The Pilgrims sought refuge far from their homeland.
They established a separate church, but they were still
subjects of the crown. They were to know little or nothing
of the future developments which were to lead eventually
to complete independence from the mother country.</p>
<p>Nevertheless they left an unparalleled example of devotion
to a cause. In pursuit of religious freedom, in
reverence, in the exigencies of primitive government, they
sowed the seed of an ideal Americanism, that God willing,
will forever endure.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
